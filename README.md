# An-Attentive-Neural-Model-for-labeling-Adverse-Drug-Reactions

This work focuses on extraction of Adverse Drug Reactions（ADRs）from ADRs-related tweets and sentences extracted from PubMed abstracts.

Our paper 《[An Attentive Neural Sequence Labeling Model for Adverse Drug Reactions Mentions Extraction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8540859)》 has been accepted by [IEEE Access](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?reload=true&punumber=6287639).

You can find more details (in Chinese) about our paper via my blog: [Sequence labeling with embedding-level attention](http://deepon.me/2018/11/18/Sequence-labeling-with-embedding-level-attention/).
